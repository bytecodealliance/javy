`proc-macro2` acts as either a thin(-ish) wrapper around the std-provided
`proc_macro` crate, or as a fallback implementation of the crate, depending on
where it is used.

If using this crate on older versions of rustc (1.56 and earlier), it will
temporarily replace the panic handler while initializing in order to detect if
it is running within a `proc_macro`, which could lead to surprising behaviour.
This should not be an issue for more recent compiler versions, which support
`proc_macro::is_available()`.

The `proc-macro2` crate's fallback behaviour is not identical to the complex
behaviour of the rustc compiler (e.g. it does not perform unicode normalization
for identifiers), however it behaves well enough for its intended use-case
(tests and scripts processing rust code).

`proc-macro2` does not use unsafe code, however exposes one `unsafe` API to
allow bypassing checks in the fallback implementation when constructing
`Literal` using `from_str_unchecked`. This was intended to only be used by the
`quote!` macro, however it has been removed
(https://github.com/dtolnay/quote/commit/f621fe64a8a501cae8e95ebd6848e637bbc79078),
and is likely completely unused. Even when used, this API shouldn't be able to
cause unsoundness.
