## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2023-05-05

### Added
- Documentation across the crate.
- Added an enum `JSValue` that represents a JavaScript value that can convert to and from Rust types with `try_into`.

### Changed
- Renamed `Value` to `JSValueRef`.
- Renamed `Context` to `JSContextRef`.
- Callback functions now work with `CallbackArg` instead of `JSValueRef` directly. `CallbackArg` can easily convert to Rust types with `try_into`.
- Relationship of `JSValueRef` and `JSContextRef` is now safer with `JSValueRef` containing a reference to `JSContextRef` instead of a raw pointer to the quickjs `JSContext`.

### Removed
- `json` and `messagepack` features have been moved to the `javy` crate
