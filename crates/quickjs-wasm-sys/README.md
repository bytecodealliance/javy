# quickjs-wasm-sys: Wasm QuickJS bindings for Rust

FFI bindings for a Wasm build of the QuickJS Javascript engine.

## Building this crate

- Install the [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk#install) for your platform
- Set the `QUICKJS_WASM_SYS_WASI_SDK_PATH` environment variable to the absolute path where you installed the `wasi-sdk`
