# Some people try to run shell scripts in WSL after cloning the repo in Windows.
# If they clone the repo in Windows and the default `core.autocrlf` settings
# are used, the shell script line endings are converted to Windows line
# endings. When they try to run the script with Windows line endings in WSL,
# they get an error because the shebang is interpreted as including a
# trailing `\r` character.
